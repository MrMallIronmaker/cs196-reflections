Microlessons

The Spring 2015 semester led to microlessons, the other pillar of the class. On the staff side, it began with a simple desire: "We want the students to know a little about... X." Because we knew the projects from the past few semesters, we knew the subjects we'd like to cover. The first microlesson was a crash course in Python - we claimed that this lecture would cover the first four weeks of CS125. Later, we broke into algorithms, data structures, web design, running a server, and a few other advanced topics.

About ten weeks into the semester, I had a conversation with Abhishek about the concept of microlessons, and we stumbled upon our different types of microlessons, but also noticed a few similar goals among all the microlessons.

Originally, the microlessons were aimed at some skill set that students would be using for their projects. These kinds of microlessons were common especially in the first few weeks, when we wanted to get students up to speed in the content of the class. Having pitched the class as one to begin with no programming experience, we now had to deliver on that promise. 

Midway during the semester, we shifted our focus to a a little farther. In covering topics like algorithms and data structures, we wanted to prepare them for writing smart code in their projects, but also begin familiarizing them to topics they'd see repeatedly in the next four years.

As the semester progressed, we started progressing to more esoteric topics. With such disparate projects, there was no way we could choose a topic to be relevant to every student. We then opted for a whirlwind tour of senior-level courses. We wanted to talk about computer architecture, machine learning, < add more here >, but how could we do so to some first-year students [albeit smart and motivated ones]?

We discussed the problems of giving these sorts of lectures to our students, knowing our own experiences in class. First, we were concerned that this material would be intimidating. There were senior-level classes about this, and we're teaching them this three months into a freshman course. Second, we were aware that most students would not be using most of the information we would be giving - but some would. Lastly, we could not cover enough material to give an accurate picture of the field we wanted to cover.

In response, we stressed three things [better word] in each lecture: do not fear the material, experience it, ask yourself if you like it and it may be something you want to pursue, and lastly, we can show you what to do if you want to continue working in this field, but you only have the experience of this class. [parallel structures better]

In the Fall 2015 semester, we added Hackerspace to specifically address this third point. In Hackerspace, our analog to office hours, we had both the general question-and-answer-and-discussion format common to the other classes we had taken, but we also had workshops led by the student who gave the microlesson. Because the students that attended Hackerspace had chosen to come that week, we could leverage the motivation the students had to make the learning more active. Instead of lecturing on another topic, the student who had given the microlesson drafted up a simple project in the field of the week and assisted the 6-10 students in completing the given project, or sometimes, a different but related project still in the field.
