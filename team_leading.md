# Team Leading
As we've told our potential staff during interviews, and as we remind them as the semester finishes, we can't run the class without them. Many classes say this, but because the projects are the most important part of the class, and the projects need project managers, we certainly mean it.

The project leaders are students who go through a short interview process. Most have taken the class before, but some join because they have heard of CS 196 and like the class model. About half of the staff continues each semester.

In the first semester, each project was split into smaller groups, each led by a project manager. Each project manager was in charge of a few of these smaller groups, but these groups shared a common theme. For example, a project manager may be in charge of three teams of three students each, working on iOS apps for projects A, B, and C. The organizational structure reflected the code these students built, and the subprojects were hard to integrate into a final project. 

In the second and third semesters, we had one person leading a team of 4 to 6 students. While we did not have systematic failures, where most teams encountered the same difficulties, we did encounter serious failures in which the project was derailed by a poor project manager. The project manager did not schedule meetings regularly, did not keep students on track, or became entirely unreachable.

In this Spring 2016 semester, we have paired experienced project managers with new staff so they can learn to run a team by guide. [ responses. ]
