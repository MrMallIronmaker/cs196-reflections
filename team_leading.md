# Team Leading

teamforming & project managers

Often the students came in with no team experience, and usually the course staff had very little experience leading a team. We stressed to the students to learn from each other, and watch.

-- interview Modi and Thomas about first semester teaming.

In the second and third semesters, we had one person leading a team of 4 to 6 students. While we did not have systematic failures, where most teams encountered the same difficulties, we did encounter catastrophic failures, in which the project was effectively derailed because of a poor project manager. In the cases we had, the project manager did not schedule meetings regularly, keep students on track, or became generally unreachable.

In this Spring 2016 semester, we have paired experienced project managers with new staff so they can learn to run a team by guide.
