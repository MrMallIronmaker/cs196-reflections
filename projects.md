projects: what and why

The team projects are the cornerstone of the CS 196 experience. In the first offering of the class, it was unofficially named The Foundry. The name pointed towards the key attitude of the class: we're going to build and make things. 

In the second semester, Thomas named the class DotStar, a reference to the regular expression '.\*'[add footnote] which represents "anything and everything." We used it in reference to the scope of the projects. In the brainstorming and teamforming stage, we were happy to accept any idea. We bragged about how some students last semester had decided to make a self-driving car. Naturally, we didn't have the resources, time, or skills for that, but instead they pivoted to simulating many self-driving cars on a road network and testing what sorts of algorithms led to the best traffic times. After students had their ideas - some of them total moonshots - the project managers would meet with the studetns on that team to scale down the moonshot ideas, focusing in on one especially cool part. I reference the Pareto Principle when discussing this idea-honing phase. You can expect 80% of the cool to come from 20% of the work. How can you best optimize the cool while bringing the work to a reasonable level?

why?

We pitched the class to the students as not only learning things your peers are not [mean tho] but also getting those soft-skills, like team experience, into their heads and their resumes. [perhaps dump data]. 

dont forget: rant about project-based learning. perhaps add the "thesis of this class" statement from last semester?

Projects provide enthusiasm, skills that separate students out from one another, show initiative, comapre well to research and industry environments, 

Many companies and even academics are looking for personal projects on resumes [citation needed]. Though this projects are technically not personal projects, we want the students to be able to have an idea, iterate on it, and execute on it.

Often the first attempts of projects are disappointments. - can I get an informal survey? huh. Learning to accept the give-and-take of the initial idea phase with the executation phase is a valuable skill to keep students motivated when they run into difficulty in their own projects.

teamforming & project managers

Often the students came in with no team experience, and usually the course staff had very little experience leading a team. We stressed to the students to learn from each other, and watch.

-- interview Modi and Thomas about first semester teaming.

In the second and third semesters, we had one person leading a team of 4 to 6 students. While we did not have systematic failures, where most teams encountered the same difficulties, we did encounter catastrophic failures, in which the project was effectively derailed because of a poor project manager. In the cases we had, the project manager did not schedule meetings regularly, keep students on track, or became generally unreachable.

In this Spring 2016 semester, we have paired experienced project managers with new staff so they can learn to run a team by guide.
