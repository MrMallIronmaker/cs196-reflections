# Team Presentations

In the Projects page, I mentioned that we wanted students to learn the soft skills colleges and employers are looking for. Public speaking is one of these soft skills that can easily be rolled into the course of the semester. There comes a time at which students have made enough progress in their projects that they have something to show and something to talk about. Good team presentations benefit both the speakers and the listeners.

With the presentation's primary goal as experience in public speaking, it is clear a good presentation is good for the presenters. We expect students to become comfortable talking to technical and non-technical audiences. The presentations usually consist of a pitch, which reminds students and staff of the original concept, a demo, which shows progress and some of their implementation details. Afterwards, the team describes their technical progress and both the technical and non-technical challenges.

Second, the students listening can learn from the group's design choices and team dynamics. By seeing the good and bad examples of other teams, they can more easily reason about their own project design and teamwork.

The length and content of the presentations has varied from semester to semester. At first, the end goal of CS 196 was a startup company, and the presentations were entirely non-technical pitches and demonstrations. In following semesters, the presentations became more technical. Without specific guidance, students do not make a distinction between technical and non-technical details, and most are quite happy to talk about the technical details they are very familiar with.

Presentations have grown from about three minutes to ten, mostly because of the question-and-answer session following the group's speaking time. Over the course of the semester, teams present two or three times, but we found that more than four presentations in a lecture is too many for students to remain interested in the different presentations.

The team presentations help students become comfortable speaking to a large number of people and allow students in different teams to learn from each other.
