Research Questions:
Can the T-shaped class in addition to CS1 increase:
interest [as measured by affect]
knowledge 
further plans in CS
Does CS196 allow students to build their identity?

What is your learning style? [Likert scale, 1 - Strongly Disagree, 7 - Strongly Agree]
I have taught myself useful skills on my own.
I spend some of my own time working on personal projects.
[looking to add some more questions]
What is your CS identity? [Likert scale, 1 - Strongly Disagree, 7 - Strongly Agree]
I had previous skills and experience before taking the class.
I consider myself a programmer.
I will be writing code in the future.
I am interested in computer science as a field.
I am interested in computer science as a profession.
The computer science community is a place I want to be involved in.
If I am assigned a programming task I know little about, I can find the tools I need to complete it.
I am able to apply CS skills in a non-CS setting
Did CS 196 help your learning? [Likert scale, 1 - Strongly Disagree, 7 - Strongly Agree]
Because of this class, I have a better idea of what I wish to study in computer science.
Because of this class, I have a better grasp on the breadth of computer science.
I gained experience in this class that I put to use in my other classes.
Through this class, I learned how to work in teams.
Was CS 196 more effective than other classes? [Likert scale, 1 - Strongly Disagree, 7 - Strongly Agree]
I prefer a project-based class over other kinds of classes. 
If a junior- or senior-level version of this class were offered, I would consider taking it.
Taking this class was a good use of my time.
Taking this class allowed me to learn more efficiently than in my other classes.
I learned more in this class than in other classes.
Rate the effect each of these factors are to you in your decision to study computer science as a class or as a major. [1 - significantly discouraged you, 4 - no effect, 7 - significantly encouraged you]

Which semester of CS 196
-- things to sort in
i have gaind soft skilsl such as communication and teamwork
i would interestd in takinga class like this again
knowing about the class what I know now, I think taking htis class was a good ddeciiosn

-- suggestions from Matt West
54. I find it easy to communicate with my teammates
56. I have made friends with people in my discussion
57. I feel like this class is a community of learners that I belong to
60. I feel like my contributions to the group are not taken seriously by all members of the group
61. When working in a group, our ideas build on each others
72. I like working on an activity over multiple weeks
73. The group project is interesting
76. I like that the project is open-ended; there are several different, but equally correct ways to do it
78. I would rather work on written problems with only one correct answer/method
79. I would rather work on the project as an individual than as part of a group

--sugestions from Cinda
This class killed my interest in CS.
 The other student in this class are obnoxious. 
The course was not well supported by the department.

1) describing achievement of outcomes vs. measuring relative performance, 2) affective vs. cognitive vs. skill outcomes, 3) describing students' felt experiences vs. creating external measures of students' experiences.

There are a variety of outcomes that you can choose. Affective outcomes are things like enjoyment, satisfaction, self-efficacy, or identity. Cognitive outcomes are usually the course content knowledge. Skill outcomes can refer to things like teamwork. Generally, I would recommend that you pick 2 or 3 or at most 5 outcomes that you want to assess and then create a series of questions that target the same outcome from multiple perspectives. For example for self-efficacy (1-strongly disagree, 4-strongly agree). "I can use my programming skills to tackle novel problems." "If I encounter a programming bug, I can determine the source of the bug." etc.

You can also focus on self report vs. external assessment. self report is appropriate for affective outcomes. external assessment is generally needed for cognitive outcomes and skill outcomes. You can use self report for cognitive and skill outcomes but students are generally poor judges of those outcomes for themselves, so you need to be very clear about how you use self report. For example, for teamwork, you can ask students to describe their teamwork behaviors and then assess whether those are good behaviors according to a theory.
