I joined CS 196 in the middle of my second year. Thomas Reese - a name you will hear often - had emailed a few of us in the fall semester, asking for course staff. I did not accept the invitation the in the fall, but my friend Tadas invited me to the project demonstration week at the end of the fall semester. I wasn't expecting much. 

Exactly a year before, I had taken the class as it had been taught in the past four years. There were apps, there were a few interesting projects; some were worth the time it took to show them, but most were not. 

This year, I came in and the lights were low, the projectors were running, and some teams wore suits. I joined my friend and some other staff members for dinner afterwards, and met some people I'd work with all the way to graduation.

This does not aim to be a personal story, however. I am writing to other computer science educators, interested in the class model for CS 196, and to new instructors and leaders, learning how to run a class or even a small team.

-:narrative, with numbers interjected. that's the best we can do:-

The University of Illinois directory lists CS 196 as "Freshman Honors". Under it, there are two sections, one for CS 125 Introduction to Computer Science ??, and CS 173 Discrete Mathematics. Officially, it's the honors add-on to CS 125, the university's incarnation of CS1. (footnote: I said I would be writing to two groups of people, CS educators and new instructors. CS1 is a computer science education term for a set of learning outcomes [things to laearn] usually put in a first-year programming class). It's officially listed as a one hour course.

I would describe the current iteration of CS 196 as a project-based exploration of computer science. The word exploration brings up images of spelunking caves or hiking trails, both of which capture many important points. First, the students are not expected to know or understand the material they are going to encounter. Second, students are surrounded by this unfamiliar material. Third, there is a guide for the students. Fourth, while there are paths well-trodden, the students are free to explore. I'll consider these points one by one.

Students are not expected to know or understand the material they are going to encounter. Unlike classes, where there are a collected set of learning outcomes over some field, most of the world they're exploring is not something to master but instead to merely taste. They do master some things, but what they learn is some intuition or "getting oriented" about most things. This is the reason behind microlessons.

Students are surrounded by unfamiliar material. Classes can train use to think that being unfamiliar with material is a scary position to be in. We aim less to get students to learn some specific topic and aim more directly at how to learn in general. Any project topic is fair game. We leave room for massively ambitious projects - in Silicon Valley terms, a moonshot - and let the students decide how to narrow their focus into something they'd like to do.

Students have a guide. Until we've solved all AI-hard problems, there's no automated solution for leading a team, gauging interest for a topic, reliably explaining concepts, and gauging effort apart from skill. The team projects have a lead, and we offer hackerspace (office hours) too. [bs warning]

Students are free to explore. In mechanical engineering, you'd need parts and a design shop to do work. In biology, you need a lab. With computer programming, all you need is a computer and some time - both are readily available for interested students. More than other fields, students come in with knowledge of the field and skills specifically applicable to a career.
