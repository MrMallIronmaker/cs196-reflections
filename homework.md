The homework we've assigned has always been a difficult choice.

Interview Thomas and Modi anout initial thoughts on homework

At first, this had the vision of the anti-homework class. You tell us what you wanted to work on. The "homework" was effectively self-assigned. This model worked well for the project-based section of the class, but not at the beginning, where students were learning the basics of programming. Because we wanted the students to all come to the projects having some skill in algorithmic thinking, we devoted the first section of the class to a short, practical introduction to programming.

In the second and third semesters, we devoted one (long) lecture at the beginning to deal with the basic constructs of programming: types of data, variables, operators, functions, conditionals, loops. In the fourth semester, we stretched out the lecture into four lectures, partially because the students in the spring semesters are usually not computer science majors and come in with less programming experience.

In each week, we gave them a homework assignment that used the previous week's material. We wanted the students to struggle with the assignment, but emphasized our availablity in office hours and also separately scheduled office hours. We wanted to ensure the student's comfort with basic programming concepts, and also teach them to ask for help when they're encountering an assignment beyond their skill level. In addition to being a truth applicable to other classes and careers, we have anecdotes that found that many students felt ashamed to ask for help and so avoided it until the next project meeting, where they could not show any work for the past week. Challenging them beyond their expected skills - while freely mentioning we were planning todo so - helped establish this positive habit quickly. 

We also require all the students to be familar with Github in order to work with the VCS in different projects and access code we provide. Then, for the fifth week, we have students upload a simple text file to our class Github, and then complete a tutorial of Git instructions.

In this fourth semester, we also took an eye towards preparing students with interview questions of algorithmic thinking. We have not assigned any yet, however.
