# cs196-reflections
Mark Miller's senior thesis consisting of reflections and analysis of three semesters of CS 196-25 Freshman Honors at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

The table of contents follows a conceptual ordering mimicked by the chronological development of the class.

The motivation of the thesis is to 

I chose this as a formal research topic because there was very little research I could build upon while approaching this class. The philosophy of the class [getting students excited about projects] follows the roots of project-based learning, but the course design and instruction questions were too specific to be answered or even informed by project-based learning theory.

In after considering and thinking about the class, I realized is it more important to dump information abou the class right now rtahter than be scientificalyl rigrous. I encourage further experiemtnations and research in tohsi field beacuase of hte students but for now all i forrer is reflections and a recount of twhat we've done .

I have two audiences in midnd: first, the future staffan d instructoris of CS 196-25. frehsman honors. Even in my hsort time, I've been a brainstorming sessions were someone suggests an idea, and later we reguse to do it because something has rememnered we did it a few smeesters ago and it' dontnt work fofr somet reason or another. 

Perhaps the design of this class is a gradient decscent problem, and we just have to randomly wanter around until we find the right slope to go donw.  I propose that the data catheried here, whicle anecdotable and rough, still will provide a useful framework for decisiions being made. 

I the second audience I am interested in is staff and intstructors f other classes clooking to implemented a clas like cs 196. I think there is a plasui le market and need for a project0based honros class, with so manty students coming in with programming skills areadly looking for a challenge but intimidated by personal projects, wisthing there weas more structure. 

I neither case, The probposals I put forward are merely three or four data points that bca easily be misinterpreted or porrly worded, not scienidicically data. I hope to provide a vocabulary for analysing a class like this and give the classes just tstarting a heads start of information we ftoook two years to trial and error to.

Enjoy!
