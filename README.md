# Reflections
This is Mark Miller's senior thesis consisting of reflections and analysis of three semesters of CS 196-25 Freshman Honors at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I chose this as a formal research topic because there was very little research I could build upon while approaching this class. The philosophy of the class, which is getting students excited about projects, follows the roots of project-based learning, but the course design and instruction questions were too specific to be answered or even informed by project-based learning theory.

After thinking about the state of the class and of the research, I realize is it more important to provide a broad record about the class rather than focus on a smaller question and be scientifically rigorous. To those who are reading this, I encourage experimentation and research in this field, but for now I offer reflections and analysis of what we have done as instructors.

I have two audiences in mind: first, the future staff and instructors of CS 196-25 Freshman Honors. Even in my short time (three semesters), I've been in conversations where someone suggests an idea that we had attempted to implement previously, and we have to recount our reasoning for abandoning the thought.

The second audience I am writing for is staff and instructors of other classes looking to implement a class like CS 196. I think there is a need for a project-based honors class. Many computer science students enter college with some programming skills but are looking to implement them in an environment more structured than a personal project but less structured than a class.

In either case, the proposals I put forward are merely three or four data points that can be poorly worded and easily misinterpreted. This is not scientifically robust data. It is a introduction to the reasoning and choices we had for multiple semesters of CS 196, and I hope to provide a vocabulary for analysis of a class like this. Lastly, I want to give other classes a head start. Our first two years were a productive time of learning, and we want to share that with you.
