# cs196-reflections
The work-in-progress of Mark Miller's reflections and analysis of three semesters of CS 196-25 Freshman Honors at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

The table of contents follows a conceptual ordering mimicked by the chronological development of the class. 

As of Apr 4, there are:
One passage written and edited, specifically Microlessons.
Two passages only written
Nine passages entirely unwritten

[talk about audience]
either you want to make a class like this
or you're currently running a class liek this

[talk about format]
I don't have much data to offer, but I'd like to compile our experiences.
so I also make it important to include our reasoning because you should make the decisions of what trade-offs you want to make
think like my hardware class - focus on the tradeoffs - trading complexity for runtime
- what were the constraints were removed from the design of the class [as a nontraditional honors class]
- what did that allow us to do?
