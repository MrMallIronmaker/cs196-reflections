Probably break it up by subject, rather than chronological order?

Talk to Thomas Reese too. See if I can gather some old reasoning.

* Previous Work, Audience, & Philosophy of the class
* Project subjects
* Team Forming
* Team leading
* Hackathons
* Microlessons
* Hackerspace / Office Hours
* Magic
* Homework
* Results as appendix?
* Future work?
