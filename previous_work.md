I chose this as a formal research topic because there was very little research I could build upon while approaching this class. The philosophy of the class [getting students excited about projects] follows the roots of project-based learning, but the course design and instruction questions were too specific to be answered or even informed by project-based learning theory.

A similar study is "Beyond the Flipped Classroom: Learning by Doing Through Challenges and Hack-a-thons" by Michael Skirpan and Tom Yeh.
